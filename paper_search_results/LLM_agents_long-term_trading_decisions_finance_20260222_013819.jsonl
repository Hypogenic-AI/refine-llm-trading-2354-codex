While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.", "citations": 7}

However, most existing trading agents operate under intraday, independent unit-based trading tasks, where decisions are made as isolated directional actions, and thus lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic market. To address this task, we propose FinPos, a position-aware trading agent system designed to explicitly model and manage continuous positions. FinPos enhances position awareness through three key mechanisms: (1) professional-level interpretation of heterogeneous market information; (2) a dual-agent decision structure that separates directional reasoning from risk-aware position adjustment; and (3) multi-timescale reward signals, allowing the agent to internalize position awareness through experiential feedback rather than static instructions alone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.", "citations": 2}

We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses.

This paper introduces an innovative multi-agent system, HedgeAgents, aimed at bolstering system robustness via ''hedging'' strategies. In this well-balanced system, an array of hedging agents has been tailored, where HedgeAgents consist of a central fund manager and multiple hedging experts specializing in various financial asset classes. These agents leverage LLMs' cognitive capabilities to make decisions and coordinate through three types of conferences. Benefiting from the powerful understanding of LLMs, our HedgeAgents attained a 70% annualized return and a 400% total return over a period of 3 years.

To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size.

To explore this, we select a financial stock market scenario to test behavioral consistency. Investors are typically classified as fundamental or technical traders, but most simulations fix strategies at initialization, failing to reflect real-world trading dynamics. In this work, we assess whether agents'strategy switching aligns with financial theory, providing a framework for this evaluation. We operationalize four behavioral-finance drivers-loss aversion, herding, wealth differentiation, and price misalignment-as personality traits set via prompting and stored long-term. In year-long simulations, agents process daily price-volume data, trade under a designated style, and reassess their strategy every 10 trading days. We introduce four alignment metrics and use Mann-Whitney U tests to compare agents'style-switching behavior with financial theory. Our results show that recent LLMs'switching behavior is only partially consistent with behavioral-finance theories, highlighting the need for further refinement in aligning agent behavior with financial theory.", "citations": 0}

Additionally, a risk-control component in FinCon enhances decision quality by episodically initiating a self-critiquing mechanism to update systematic investment beliefs. The conceptualized beliefs serve as verbal reinforcement for the future agent's behavior and can be selectively propagated to the appropriate node that requires knowledge updates. This feature significantly improves performance while reducing unnecessary peer-to-peer communication costs.

Yet, the memory processing of GPTs does not precisely emulate the hierarchical nature of human memory. This can result in LLMs struggling to prioritize immediate and critical tasks efficiently. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative LLM multi-agent framework endowed with layered memories. We assert that this framework is well-suited for stock and fund trading, where the extraction of highly relevant insights from hierarchical financial data is imperative to inform trading decisions. Within this framework, one agent organizes memory into three distinct layers, each governed by a custom decay mechanism, aligning more closely with human cognitive processes. Agents can also engage in inter-agent debate. In financial trading contexts, LLMs serve as the decision core for trading agents, leveraging their layered memory system to integrate multi-source historical actions and market insights. This equips them to navigate financial changes, formulate strategies, and debate with peer agents about investment decisions.

We conclude with actionable recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and regulators: audit risk-aware metrics in future studies, publish stress scenarios alongside datasets, and treat ``safety budget'' as a primary success criterion. Only by redefining what ``good'' looks like can the community responsibly advance AI-driven finance.", "citations": 5}

To address these complexities, we introduce TRIBE an agent-based model (ABM) augmented with a large language model (LLM) to simulate human-like decision-making in trading environments. TRIBE leverages publicly available data and stylized facts to capture realistic trading dynamics, integrating human biases like risk aversion and ambiguity sensitivity into the decision-making processes of agents. Our research yields three key contributions: first, we demonstrate that integrating LLMs into ABMs, to enhance client agency, is feasible and enriches the simulation of agent behaviors in complex markets; second, we find that even slight trade aversion encoded within the LLM leads to a complete cessation of trading activity, highlighting the sensitivity of market dynamics to agents' risk profiles; third, we show that incorporating human-like variability shifts power dynamics towards clients and can disproportionately affect the entire system, often resulting in systemic agent collapse across simulations. These findings underscore the emergent properties that arise when introducing stochastic, human-like decision processes, revealing new system behaviors that enhance the realism and complexity of artificial trading societies.", "citations": 1}

However, existing systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting, trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions. Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting, style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing LLM-based trading strategies.", "citations": 3}

However, decision-making in fully dynamic and live environments remains highly challenging, requiring real-time information integration and adaptive responses. While existing efforts have explored live evaluation mechanisms in structured tasks, a critical gap remains in systematic benchmarking for real-world applications, particularly in finance where stringent requirements exist for live strategic responsiveness. To address this gap, we introduce AI-Trader, the first fully-automated, live, and data-uncontaminated evaluation benchmark for LLM agents in financial decision-making. AI-Trader spans three major financial markets: U.S. stocks, A-shares, and cryptocurrencies, with multiple trading granularities to simulate live financial environments. Our benchmark implements a revolutionary fully autonomous minimal information paradigm where agents receive only essential context and must independently search, verify, and synthesize live market information without human intervention. We evaluate six mainstream LLMs across three markets and multiple trading frequencies. Our analysis reveals striking findings: general intelligence does not automatically translate to effective trading capability, with most agents exhibiting poor returns and weak risk management. We demonstrate that risk control capability determines cross-market robustness, and that AI trading strategies achieve excess returns more readily in highly liquid markets than policy-driven environments. These findings expose critical limitations in current autonomous agents and provide clear directions for future improvements.

Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles: (i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1) high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and (3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.", "citations": 3}

These phenomena suggest the presence of path dependence in price formation, where investor decisions are influenced not only by current market conditions but also by the trajectory of prices leading up to the present. Path dependence has drawn attention in behavioral finance as a key mechanism behind such anomalies. One plausible driver of path dependence is human loss aversion, anchored to individual reference points like purchase prices or past peaks, which vary with personal context. However, capturing such subtle behavioral tendencies in traditional agent-based market simulations has remained a challenge. We propose the Fundamental-Chartist-LLM-Agent (FCLAgent), which uses large language models (LLMs) to emulate human-like trading decisions. In this framework, (1) buy/sell decisions are made by LLMs based on individual situations, while (2) order price and volume follow standard rule-based methods. Simulations show that FCLAgents reproduce path-dependent patterns that conventional agents fail to capture. Furthermore, an analysis of FCLAgents'behavior reveals that the reference points guiding loss aversion vary with market trajectories, highlighting the potential of LLM-based agents to model nuanced investor behavior.", "citations": 1}

Such evaluations assess each policy independently, overlook correlations and interactions, and fail to explain why strategies ultimately persist or vanish in evolving markets. We shift to an ecological perspective, where trading strategies are modeled as adaptive agents that interact and learn within a shared market. Instead of proposing a new strategy, we present FinEvo, an ecological game formalism for studying the evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent financial strategies. At the individual level, heterogeneous ML-based traders-rule-based, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model (LLM) agents-adapt using signals such as historical prices and external news. At the population level, strategy distributions evolve through three designed mechanisms-selection, innovation, and environmental perturbation-capturing the dynamic forces of real markets. Together, these two layers of adaptation link evolutionary game theory with modern learning dynamics, providing a principled environment for studying strategic behavior. Experiments with external shocks and real-world news streams show that FinEvo is both stable for reproducibility and expressive in revealing context-dependent outcomes. Strategies may dominate, collapse, or form coalitions depending on their competitors-patterns invisible to static backtests. By reframing strategy evaluation as an ecological game formalism, FinEvo provides a unified, mechanism-level protocol for analyzing robustness, adaptation, and emergent dynamics in multi-agent financial markets, and may offer a means to explore the potential impact of macroeconomic policies and financial regulations on price evolution and equilibrium.", "citations": 0}

Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks by leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, these approaches are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT typically requires rapid, risk-aware decisions driven by structured, short-horizon signals, such as technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend features. These signals stand in sharp contrast to the long-horizon, text-driven reasoning that characterizes most existing LLM-based systems in finance. To bridge this gap, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents--Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk--each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. Extensive experiments across nine financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, demonstrate that QuantAgent consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher predictive accuracy at both 1-hour and 4-hour trading intervals across multiple evaluation metrics.

Despite the importance of this latency quality trade off, it remains underexplored in the context of LLM based agents. In this work, we present the first systematic study of this trade off in real time decision making tasks.

Our analysis reveals that optimal latency quality balance varies by task, and that sacrificing quality for lower latency can significantly enhance downstream performance. To address this, we propose FPX, an adaptive framework that dynamically selects model size and quantization level based on real time demands. Our method achieves the best performance on both benchmarks, improving win rate by up to 80% in Street Fighter and boosting daily yield by up to 26.52% in trading, underscoring the need for latency aware evaluation and deployment strategies for LLM based agents.

Through EconAgentic, we simulate how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance of decentralized, tokenized economies.", "citations": 0}

Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a dataset of evolved strategies to support future research.", "citations": 0}
{"title": "Evaluating and Aligning Human Economic Risk Preferences in LLMs", "year": 2025, "authors": "Jiaxin Liu, Yi Yang, K. Tam", "url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:276902692", "relevance": 1, "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making scenarios that involve risk assessment, yet their alignment with human economic rationality remains unclear. In this study, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit risk preferences consistent with human expectations across different personas. Specifically, we assess whether LLM-generated responses reflect appropriate levels of risk aversion or risk-seeking behavior based on individual's persona. Our results reveal that while LLMs make reasonable decisions in simplified, personalized risk contexts, their performance declines in more complex economic decision-making tasks. To address this, we propose an alignment method designed to enhance LLM adherence to persona-specific risk preferences. Our approach improves the economic rationality of LLMs in risk-related applications, offering a step toward more human-aligned AI decision-making.", "citations": 6}

Bosse, Lawrence Phillips", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7edf4733ae230433f09fb5cdd3f43cca7926f41", "relevance": 1, "abstract": "We present initial results of a forthcoming benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on white-collar tasks of economic value. We evaluate agents on real-world\"messy\"open-web research tasks of the type that are routine in finance and consulting. In doing so, we lay the groundwork for an LLM agent evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large economic and societal impact. We built and tested several agent architectures with o1-preview, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini. On average, LLM agents powered by Claude-3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and reflecting on their observations. Our evaluation represents the first in-depth assessment of agents' abilities to conduct challenging, economically valuable analyst-style research on the real open web.", "citations": 3}
