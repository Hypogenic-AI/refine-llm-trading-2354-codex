    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.",

    "abstract": "The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial trading. However, most existing trading agents operate under intraday, independent unit-based trading tasks, where decisions are made as isolated directional actions, and thus lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic market. To address this task, we propose FinPos, a position-aware trading agent system designed to explicitly model and manage continuous positions. FinPos enhances position awareness through three key mechanisms: (1) professional-level interpretation of heterogeneous market information; (2) a dual-agent decision structure that separates directional reasoning from risk-aware position adjustment; and (3) multi-timescale reward signals, allowing the agent to internalize position awareness through experiential feedback rather than static instructions alone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores designing artificial organizations with professional behavior in investments using a multi-agent simulation. The method mimics hierarchical decision-making in investment firms, using news articles to inform decisions. A large-scale study analyzing over 115,000 news articles of 300 companies across 15 years compared this approach against professional traders' decisions. Results show that hierarchical simulations align closely with professional choices, both in frequency and profitability. However, the study also reveals biases in decision-making, where changes in prompt wording and perceived agent seniority significantly influence outcomes. This highlights both the potential and limitations of large language models in replicating professional financial decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.",

    "abstract": "As automated trading gains traction in the financial market, algorithmic investment strategies are increasingly prominent. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agent-based models exhibit promising potential in real-time market analysis and trading decisions, they still experience a significant -20% loss when confronted with rapid declines or frequent fluctuations, impeding their practical application. Hence, there is an imperative to explore a more robust and resilient framework. This paper introduces an innovative multi-agent system, HedgeAgents, aimed at bolstering system robustness via ''hedging'' strategies. In this well-balanced system, an array of hedging agents has been tailored, where HedgeAgents consist of a central fund manager and multiple hedging experts specializing in various financial asset classes. These agents leverage LLMs' cognitive capabilities to make decisions and coordinate through three types of conferences. Benefiting from the powerful understanding of LLMs, our HedgeAgents attained a 70% annualized return and a 400% total return over a period of 3 years. Moreover, we have observed with delight that HedgeAgents can even formulate investment experience comparable to those of human experts (https://hedgeagents.github.io/).",

    "abstract": "We introduce Look-Ahead-Bench, a standardized benchmark measuring look-ahead bias in Point-in-Time (PiT) Large Language Models (LLMs) within realistic and practical financial workflows. Unlike most existing approaches that primarily test inner lookahead knowledge via Q\\\\&A, our benchmark evaluates model behavior in practical scenarios. To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

    "abstract": "Recent works have increasingly applied Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents in financial stock market simulations to test if micro-level behaviors aggregate into macro-level phenomena. However, a crucial question arises: Do LLM agents'behaviors align with real market participants? This alignment is key to the validity of simulation results. To explore this, we select a financial stock market scenario to test behavioral consistency. Investors are typically classified as fundamental or technical traders, but most simulations fix strategies at initialization, failing to reflect real-world trading dynamics. In this work, we assess whether agents'strategy switching aligns with financial theory, providing a framework for this evaluation. We operationalize four behavioral-finance drivers-loss aversion, herding, wealth differentiation, and price misalignment-as personality traits set via prompting and stored long-term. In year-long simulations, agents process daily price-volume data, trade under a designated style, and reassess their strategy every 10 trading days. We introduce four alignment metrics and use Mann-Whitney U tests to compare agents'style-switching behavior with financial theory. Our results show that recent LLMs'switching behavior is only partially consistent with behavioral-finance theories, highlighting the need for further refinement in aligning agent behavior with financial theory.",
